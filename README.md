# Neuralife

Neuralife is the name of my [blog](https://hash-ir.github.io/about/) created with ❤️ using Jekyll and github-pages. I write mostly about academic stuff, sometimes about fictional crossovers and philosophical stories. If you find something interesting on my blog, make sure to ⭐️ this repository so others can know about it. 

## Features
I have used [Lanyon](https://lanyon.getpoole.com/), a minimalistic jekyll theme. I also added the following features on top which make this blog exceedingly amazing: 
* Disqus comments (June 10, 2020)
* Author name and short description below each post (June 15, 2020) 
* Google Analytics (July 7, 2020)
* Categorization of posts by tags (August 20, 2020)
* MathJax support for math expressions (August 20, 2020)
* Link preview using `jekyll-seo-tag` (September 4, 2020) - *needs improvement*
* Create drafts of posts without publishing (September 4, 2020)

I will update the readme with a detailed guide about each feature!
