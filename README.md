# My Blog
This repository consists of the statically generated [webpage](https://hash-ir.github.io/about/) (blog) using jekyll and github-pages. I have used a minimalistic jekyll theme - [Lanyon](https://lanyon.getpoole.com/) which is pleasingly beautiful thanks to [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo). I have added the following features on top which make this blog exceedingly amazing: 
* Disqus comments (June 10, 2020)
* Author name and short description below each post (June 15, 2020) 
* Google Analytics (July 7, 2020)
* Categorization of posts by tags (August 20, 2020)
* MathJax support for math expressions (August 20, 2020)
* Link preview using `jekyll-seo-tag` (September 4, 2020) - *needs improvement*
* Create drafts of posts without publishing (September 4, 2020)

I will update the readme with a detailed guide about each feature!
