**Hi** ðŸ‘‹, I am Hashir Ahmad, an M.Sc. student at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/). I am writing my Master Thesis in collaboration with the [Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence (in foundation)](https://www.neuro.mpg.de/en). In the recent months, I have developed big interest in **Graph Neural Networks** and their real-world applications. Apart from this, I also find deep interest in **Generative Modeling** and have been working on **Computer Vision** problems since the last three years. Check my [CV](https://hash-ir.github.io/cv) for more details.
