*Forrest Gump arrives in New York City and goes to MacLaren's pub. There, he meets Barney Stinson*

Forrest: (to the bartender) Hi, I would like a martini, please

Barney: Do you also want a brunette on top?

Forrest: (having no idea what a brunette means) No, thank you. I don't drink much alcohol

Barney: (checks him out) Yeah, you don't. Barney. Barney Stinson.

Forrest: Forrest. Forrest Gump.

(a lady arrives at the bar)

Barney: Have you met Gump?
        
Lady: (looks at Forrest)

Forrest: (awkwardly) Hello!

(lady walks away)

Barney: Don't worry. Under my watch, you will score tonight.

Forrest: Score?! What are we playing?

(another lady walks towards the bar)

Barney: (to the lady) A game I like to call "Have you met Forrest?"

Lady: Ah. No!

Forrest: Hello. My name is Forrest. Forrest Gumppp!

Lady: (laughs) And what is your name?

Barney: Doesn't matter. So, you, him, tonight? 

Lady: No chance, loser!
