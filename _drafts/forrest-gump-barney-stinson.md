> How would Forrest Gump react when he meets Barney Stinson who offers to be his wingman?

**Prologue**

Forrest Gump takes Jenny to New York City for a tour. They go to Central Perk for coffee. There, they meet Joey and the gang.

Forrest: (to Gunther) Hi there Sir, I would like two cups of coffee please. Jenny, would you like something else?

Jenny: No, that will be all Forrest. I am going to sit there (sits on the couch)

*Forrest pays Gunther while Joey arrives at the cafe and checks out Jenny*

Joey: How you doing?

Jenny: I am sorry?!

Forrest: Hello!

Joey: Oh man, I am really sorry. I didn't see you there

Jenny: Forrest, this guy was hitting on me

Forrest: Sir that is not a good thing to do.
