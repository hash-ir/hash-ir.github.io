    About me
  </h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Hi, I am Hashir Ahmad. A graduate student at the Technical
    University of Munich. I am currently working as a Graduate Assistant
    at Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology. My work is focused on Connectomics
    where our research group is performing automated synaptic connectivity
    inference based on dense EM segmentation data. Previously, I was employed as a 
    Working Student at Huawei Munich Research Center where I worked on modeling thermogram data and 
    operational parameters of a 2x2 RF Chipset.

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Additionally, I mentor undergraduate students as part of the 
    <a href="http://ssgsa.us/">SSGSA (Sir Syed Global Scholar Award)</a> organization. 
    In practical terms, my goal is to guide the selected scholars in their admission
    processes into Universities.

  <h3>Blog</h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    On this platform, I write technical articles, fan-fiction and stories. Being busy with my Master's life,
    the blog is not very populated and needs quite a bit of
    work. Nonetheless, I will be updating it with some thought 
    provoking content in the future. Find some of the articles that I have
    written <a href="#">here</a>.
