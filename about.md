  Sic Mundus Creatus Est -- Thus, the world was created.

This blog is a platform where I share what I am doing. Mostly academia related stuff but also some fan fiction and stories. It is still the early days so you will see it as a deserted land. Hopefully, it will be populated with some thought provoking content. I look forward to that!!!

A little bit about myself. Iâ€™m a graduate student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) pursuing Masters in Informatics. My career interests lie at the union of Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I also have a growing interest in Deep Generative models, with a particular application in Computer Vision. While living in Germany, I have pushed myself to learn Deutsch which has proven very beneficial for me.
