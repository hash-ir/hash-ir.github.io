  Sic Mundus Creatus Est -- And thus, the world was created.

Iâ€™m a graduate student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) pursuing Masters in Informatics. My career interests lie at the union of Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I also have a growing interest in Deep Generative models, with a particular application in Computer Vision. While living in Germany, I have also pushed myself to learn the language which has proven very beneficial for me.

I am employed part-time as a Working Student (Werkstudent) at Huawei Munich Research Center. At Huawei, I am reinforcing my academic skills, gaining valuable insights on a real-world problem and developing corporate know-how. Being a Sir Syed Global Scholar [1], I also provide guidance and support to undergraduates exploring higher education in Germany.

Here are my top skills:
* Python
* PyTorch 
* NumPy
* OpenCV
* Pandas
* Git

Ultimately, I intend to pursue a job that most directly promotes my learned skills and provides equal opportunity for growth and development.
