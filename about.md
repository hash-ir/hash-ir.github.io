This is a platform where I share mostly academia related stuff but also some fan fiction and stories. It is still the early days so you will see it as a deserted land. Hopefully, it will be populated with some thought provoking content in the future.

A little bit about myself. Iâ€™m a graduate student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). My career interests lie at the union of Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I also have a growing interest in Deep Generative models. I have been a Working Student at Huawei Munich Research Center. During that time, I worked on the project "Thermogram based RF Chipset evaluation" which reinforced my skills and developed a corporate know-how within me. While living in Germany, I have also pushed myself to learn Deutsch which has proven very beneficial.
