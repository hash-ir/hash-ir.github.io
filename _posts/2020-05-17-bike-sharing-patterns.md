This post is about my implementation of Project 1 of the [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) from Udacity. In this project, I built a fully connected Neural Network using NumPy. The process involved initializing the network parameters, computing the forward pass and loss, backpropagating the loss to compute the gradients and updating the parameters using the gradients.
