> How would Sheldon Cooper react to Noah arriving at his place and asking to travel with him to the year 1987?

**Prologue** 

Noah arrives in Pasadena California a day before the apocalypse (June 26, 2020) to save Sheldon Cooper. He believes Sheldon’s knowledge about the String Theory and Quantum Physics might be helpful to find a loophole in the never-ending cycle of time. 

*Noah time travels from the future and arrives at 2311, North Los Robles Avenue, Pasadena, California*

Noah: (knocks at the door)

Sheldon: (opens the door) Hello, how can I help you?

Noah: I am Noah. You are exactly as Adam told me. 

Sheldon: Mister, I am exactly how the universe wanted me to be. I am a theoretical physicist who answers the questions about the universe. I can’t really imagine myself being someone else. I am flattered that your acquaintance Adam feels that way about me but I am afraid to say, I don’t have the slightest idea who you happen to be.

Noah: (smirks) don’t worry, you will get to know all about me and yourself in the time to come.

Sheldon: Remarkable! Do you also work in the field of science?

Noah: No. I am…

Sheldon: (interrupts Noah) what’s your educational background?

Noah: I am a pastor. I work in the service of God.

Sheldon: Wait, what? Did my mother sent you from Texas? Highly likely but your accent says otherwise.

Noah: Your role in all this is much bigger than you think. I am only a pawn in this game and I have to get you to Adam.

Sheldon: Adam, Noah? Is this some kind of a roleplay? Did Howard sent you to do a prank on me?

Noah: God has a plan for each one of us. For me, for you, for everyone. What I am saying might seem convoluted to you but it will all make sense later.

Sheldon: Oh, c’mon. I’ll tell you what’s convoluted. String Theory is convoluted! What we are having right now is nothing short of an uninformative exchange of ideas. What a waste of time!

Noah: (walks down the stairs) There’s nothing but chaos out there…

Leonard: Who was it?

Sheldon: Interesting! A pastor who is deeply interested in my life and wanted to take me somewhere. Then again, who might not be interested to meet Sheldon Cooper? (smiles)

*Sheldon, Leonard, Raj and Howard arrive at the university*

Sheldon: (to Howard) Howard Wolowitz, you should know that your sick prank was turned upside down. Better luck next time, but you of all should know that you cannot fool me. 

Howard: What are you talking about? If I pulled a prank on you, you would shit your pants! (laughs) 

Sheldon: haha! No!

Raj: What happened? 

Leonard: No, don’t ask….

Sheldon: Glad you asked. This morning, a pastor dressed immaculately but having the mind of a simpleton showed up at our door and wanted to take me somewhere. I don’t know why but some part of me believes he wanted some answers that I have been finding throughout my life. Well, who knows, we might bump into each other again.

Leonard, Howard, Raj: (smiling) Hmmm….you should have gone with him to see for yourself.

*Noah arrives at the university canteen...*

Sheldon: Oh dear lord…How does he know where I work? That’s the person I am talking about.

Noah: I know how you arrived here and where you will go next. I also know how your friends are going to spend the day today.  
Leonard: What do you mean?

Sheldon: Hang on…Given the fact that you know everything, I would like to know what I am going to do next. 

Noah: In the next hour, you will be travelling with me to the year 1987.

Leonard: Yay!

Sheldon: I don’t find that amusing. And I am afraid to tell you I can change your foreseeable future right now. In the next hour, I will be sitting here and you, sir, would be making a fool of yourself.

Noah: We’re not free in what we do, because we’re not free in what we desire.

Raj: Finally we have someone’s crazy matching with Sheldon’s crazy.

Sheldon: I’m not crazy! My mother had me tested.

Leonard: (to Noah) Wait a sec. Who are you really?

Howard: (whispers to Raj) Some creep I believe…

Noah: I am Noah. This thing between us has happened before. He told me about you, Adam. And how this exact moment happens. I have to take him with me to the year 1987. There is going to be an apocalypse in your time tomorrow. And everyone will be dead and the cycle will repeat. Sheldon is the key to change this and find a loophole which can prevent the apocalypse from happening. 

Raj: Wowwww!

Sheldon: As much as I like being the superhero in your story, I say you should stop this non-sense right now and leave us. 

Howard: I am actually a bit disappointed that you considered Sheldon to save the world (laughs)

Leonard: In our time? What do you mean in our time?

Noah (grabs Sheldon’s arm): It is time!

*Sheldon wakes up from his sleep*

Leonard: Good morning, Sheldon. You are sweating, is everything all right?

Sheldon: Leonard, I had a very bad…

*Someone knocks at the door...*

Sheldon: Oh no…
