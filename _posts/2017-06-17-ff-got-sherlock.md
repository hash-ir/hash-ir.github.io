*21<sup>st</sup> century London...*

Mrs. Hudson: Sherlock!!! Sherlock!! You’ve got a letter……with an unusual seal on it.
(climbs up the stairs)

Sherlock: (Looking at the wall mysteriously)

Mrs. Hudson: What in god’s name are you doing? You’ve got a…

John: I’ll take it. Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.
(shuts the door)

John: It has in fact an unusual seal. Look at it. Sherlock, you listening?

Sherlock: Yes, Jawn. I am very much here. What does the letter say?

John: (opens the letter) It says about the mysterious death of some woman Lyanna Stark, wife of a King Robert Baratheon. And that the King wants us to look into the matter. King? Have you heard of this guy?

Sherlock: No. Read on!

John: That’s pretty much it. It is signed by Lord Eddard Stark who has proclaimed himself as Hand of the King. Ah, this explains the symbol on the seal. The Hand!

Sherlock: Give me that!
(studies the letter)

John: (after some time) Anything?

Sherlock: Not much. Except for the fact that they have used the parchment paper, unlike any you will find in England. Further, to go along with the parchment, our addresser has used the vintage ink and quill, with the quill being a feather of a large bird, to explain the scaling of the letters. Wait!!!!!

John: What?!

Sherlock: (jumps in bed) This letter has been sent from a place called Westeros.

John: Westeros? (looks it up in his computer)

Sherlock: No point, John. It is not a real place! Well, it is for them.

John: Whaaat?

Sherlock: You are not seeing through it, John. Remember last year, the case I solved sitting on the plane in those few minutes before departure.

John: Yes, you have told me about it. And how, in your mind palace, I was there with you as well. But what has that got to do with this?

Sherlock: Everything!!! The parchment, ink, King. Now, do you know any King by that name? Or a place called Westeros? It is all other-worldly. I have to solve this case in my mind palace. You with me?

John: Sherlock….you have been out of your mind a couple of times. But this time, there’s no coming back for you. And I can’t help with this madness.

Sherlock: I’ll take that as a yes.
(enters mind palace)

John: Here we go again!

*somewhere in Westeros...*

Sherlock: C’mon John! We have to reach King’s Landing.

John: Have you seen this place? We won’t be able to survive even a day here.

Sherlock: Who cares? We have a case to solve. And we have been summoned by none other than the King of this world. No one’s going to touch us.

John: (Nods reluctantly)

*stranger passing by...*

John: Mister! Mister!!!!

Sherlock: Don’t say that John. We are no longer in London.

John: Then what?!

Sherlock: Try Sir or Lord.

John: Sir? When did the Queen of England knighted him? (Laughs)

John: Sir!!! Over here!

Stranger: (heavy voice) Yes?

John: We are heading to King’s Landing. Could you tell us the direction?

Stranger: Me and my mates are heading to King’s Landing. You two can saddle up on one of our horses.

John: Thank You, Sir.

Stranger: (Laughs) Ser? Oh I wish. I am just a steward at King’s Landing.

John: (angrily looks at Sherlock)

Sherlock: WHAT? We got a free ride!

*at King’s Landing...*

Stranger: Here you go mates.

John: We actually wanted to meet the King.

Stranger: You see that tower up there. That’s the Red Keep, where the King resides.

John: Seven blessings to you.

Sherlock: Where did you learn that from?

John: I heard a passer by saying it when we were travelling.

Sherlock: Impressive, John!! Let’s meet the King now, shall we?

*at Great Hall, Red Keep...*

Ned: You have arrived. Seven blessings to you, Sherlock and John Watson. I am Lord Eddard Stark—Hand of the King, Lord of Winterfell, and Warden of the North.

Sherlock: Sherlock—Consulting Detective. And he is…

John: (interrupting) I am John Watson. Dr. John Watson.

Ned: King Robert will be very pleased to see you.

*Robert Baratheon arrives...*

Robert: Ah! So you are SHERLOCK. Have heard much about you.

Sherlock: So I am. But I have heard nothing about you.

Robert: (Laughs) Then I think we’ll be done with this within no time.

Sherlock: (Observes his surroundings. An Iron Throne, made entirely of swords. The King, Baratheon. 60 something. Old enough to die on his bed at any time. The hand, Stark. Now, what’s his role? Lyanna Stark. Stark! Hand’s sister? Interesting!!)

John: (whispers) Sherlock!

Sherlock: Ah, yes! I will take the case, King Robert.
