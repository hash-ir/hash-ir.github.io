Detecing facial keypoints is a very challenging problem. Facial features vary greatly from one individual to another, and even for a single individual, there is a large amount of variation due to 3D pose, size, position, viewing angle, and illumination conditions. In this post, I have laid out a real-time implementation of Facial Keypoints Detection. For this task, I have used a trimmed down version of the original dataset provided by [Dr. Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/). The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/overview).
