This post is about my implementation of Project 2 of the [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) from Udacity. In this project, I built two Convolutional Neural Networks for identifying the dog breed. The first was about implementing a CNN in PyTorch with a full feature extractor and classifier. For the second network, I used a pretrained VGG16 model and modified the classifier part to output the dog breeds instead of the ImageNet classes.
