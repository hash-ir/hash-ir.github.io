I think everyone who is training and validating models with the help of state-of-the art deep learning frameworks should know about model deployment. In the four part series, we will look into the steps involved in deploying a Machine Learning model using Amazon Web Services. The four parts have the following content: 

* **Part 1: Machine Learning workflow and Amazon Sagemaker**
* **Part 2: Jupyter Notebooks and Amazon S3 buckets?**
* **Part 3: Training, Validation, Hyperparamter tuning and Updating a model**
* **Part 4: Deployment using Amazon Lambda and API Gateway**
